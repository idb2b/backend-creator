## Purchase agreement
The general terms of service, described on this page, determine the terms of agreement between you as a customer and myself.ae. These terms apply to you who has created one or multiple store profile(s) or purchased a service product (job add and/or job package) on myself.ae. The general terms of service apply in cases where no other written agreements have been made between you as a customer and myself.ae.
<br>
<br>
These Terms are governed by Danish Law / U.A.E. Law and you can bring proceedings in respect of the Service(s) or any dispute arising under or in connection with these Terms in the Danish courts / U.A.E. courts.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## The Agreement
The agreement on the subscription or the posting of job ads is concluded between you (the person / representative who creates the subscription or submits a job posting) and myself.ae. The agreement assumes that you have a valid email address, a valid credit card and/or a valid billing address, and that you are of legal age.
<br>
<br>
The agreement only applies to the myself.ae services described in section 6: Product Information. None of your rights or obligations under the agreement or parts thereof may be transferred to third parties without our consent.
<br>
<br>
Once you have placed your order, you will receive an email acknowledging the exact details of your order. The final agreement between you (as a customer) and myself.ae is considered concluded when your order has been received by myself.ae and confirmed by myself.ae.
<br>
<br>
All communications, including but not limited to service announcements, notification letters, newsletters, product changes, reminders and debt collection, are made electronically to the email address you have provided. You must therefore ensure that we always have your correct email address. Emails are considered delivered to you when we have sent the email to your stated email address. We make reservations for typing errors in our communication and on the Website myself.ae
<br>
<br>
The start date of the agreement is stated in your order confirmation which you receive by email after your purchase has been submitted. The order confirmation, combined with the general terms and conditions, is the basis for the agreement. In the event of a discrepancy in general terms, the first point applies to the second point and so forth.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Validity of the agreement
The agreement is valid from the time you receive an order confirmation from myself.ae or at the latest when the purchased product/service is published on myself.ae. The agreement is binding when we have confirmed your order. The agreement may be terminated by both parties.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Customer information and data
As part of the conclusion of the agreement, you must provide us with your name, the name of the company you represent, the telephone number, and a valid email address to which we may send you notices regarding our agreements.
<br>
<br>
You are obligated to immediately update the information connected with your myself.ae account should you change your email address and/or business address. If you do not immediately notify us of your new e-mail address and/or business address, we may choose to terminate the agreement or limit, block or close down the service subscription and charge you for the termination period. Equally, it’s your responsibility to update the brand's/company's store profile. This you can do by entering your account page (settings) and choose the tab "manage stores".
<br>
<br>
Any fees charged on invoices, blocking/termination of subscription or transfer to debt collection due to a lack of updating email address or change of address that has not been notified to myself.ae is incumbent on you. A change of address and/or email address is not considered a termination on your part.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Ordering and payment
All our displayed prices on the website are excl. VAT. The price at the time of order is the applicable price for the purchase. myself.ae makes reservations for misprints, price errors, VAT and tax changes.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Ordering
Once you have placed your order, you will receive an email confirming the exact details of your order as well as an online confirmation. Should you not receive this confirmation, please contact us.

<br>

<br>
<br>

## Termination
You may terminate the agreement by contacting myself.ae by email or in writing.
<br>
<br>
You are responsible for terminating / deleting your store profiles and job posts at myself.dk unless otherwise agreed. Please note that it is only the contract manager who can terminate the agreement on behalf of the company, which is why a termination made by telephone will be rejected. Unless otherwise agreed, myself.ae may terminate the agreement with one month's notice. However, myself.ae, in cases where an account holder abuses the Service or exploits it for criminal activity, can terminate the agreement immediately and without notice.
<br>
